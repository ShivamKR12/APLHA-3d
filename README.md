# Basic 3D Voxel Game in Python

## Project Setup

1. Initialize a new Python project and set up a virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install ursina
   ```
3. Create a `main.py` file to serve as the entry point.

## Game Framework

1. Set up the game window using Ursina.
2. Create a basic player controller with first-person movement.

## Voxel System

1. Implement a voxel class to represent blocks in the world.
2. Define basic voxel properties, such as size, color, and texture.

## Terrain Generation

1. Use procedural generation to create a flat or hilly terrain.
2. Optional: Integrate noise functions (e.g., Perlin or Simplex noise) for more realistic terrain.

## Block Interaction

1. Add functionality to place and remove blocks using the mouse.
2. Highlight the targeted block for better interaction feedback.

## Physics and Collision

1. Integrate basic collision detection to prevent the player from walking through blocks or falling out of the terrain.
2. Ensure smooth movement across the terrain.

## Lighting and Shading

1. Add ambient lighting and shadows for a more immersive experience.
2. Optional: Implement a day-night cycle.

## Game Optimization

1. Implement greedy meshing for voxel optimization to reduce the number of drawn faces.
2. Integrate chunk-based rendering for performance improvements in larger worlds.

## Save and Load System

1. Allow saving the current state of the world (e.g., blocks placed/removed) to a file.
2. Implement a loading system to restore the saved world.

## Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add textures to blocks for better visual quality.
2. Introduce additional block types (e.g., dirt, stone, water).
3. Add player tools or inventory for block management.

## Block Interaction Details

### Placing and Removing Blocks

- **Placing Blocks**: To place a block, hover over an existing block and press the left mouse button. A new block will be placed adjacent to the existing block in the direction you are facing.
- **Removing Blocks**: To remove a block, hover over the block you want to remove and press the right mouse button. The block will be removed from the world.

### Code Example

Here is an example of how block interaction is implemented in the `main.py` file:

```python
from ursina import Ursina, Entity, color, mouse
from ursina.prefabs.first_person_controller import FirstPersonController

class Voxel(Entity):
    def __init__(self, position=(0,0,0)):
        super().__init__(
            model='cube',
            color=color.white,
            texture='white_cube',
            position=position
        )

    def input(self, key):
        if self.hovered:
            if key == 'left mouse down':
                Voxel(position=self.position + mouse.normal)
            if key == 'right mouse down':
                destroy(self)

app = Ursina()

for z in range(8):
    for x in range(8):
        Voxel(position=(x,0,z))

player = FirstPersonController()
app.run()
```

This code sets up a basic voxel world where you can place and remove blocks using the mouse.
