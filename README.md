# APLHA-3D: A 3D Voxel Game in Python

APLHA-3D is an experimental voxel-based 3D game developed using Python. This project leverages the power of Python for creating 3D games, providing a foundation for complex gameplay mechanics such as dynamic world generation, block interaction, and a user-controlled environment.

This game is a great starting point for anyone interested in learning how to build 3D games or working with voxel engines. APLHA-3D showcases basic 3D graphics rendering, physics, and player control, offering an accessible yet powerful framework for further development.

## Key Features
- **Voxel Terrain Generation**: The world is built from individual cubes (voxels), allowing for large, procedurally generated environments.
- **Block Manipulation**: Players can place and remove blocks in the environment, modifying the world dynamically.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Simulated lighting effects to enhance visual realism.
- **Simple Exploration**: The game supports basic player controls for moving through the voxel world.
- **Camera Control**: The player can freely navigate the world using camera movement.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run APLHA-3D on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
APLHA-3D requires Python 3.6 or higher. If you don’t have Python installed, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

### Step-by-step Setup
1. **Clone the repository**  
   First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivamKR12/APLHA-3d.git

2. **Navigate into the project folder**
   Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd APLHA-3d

3. **Install dependencies**
   APLHA-3D uses several Python libraries, including Ursina for rendering and input handling.
   Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run the game**
   Once all dependencies are installed, you can launch the game by running:
   ```bash
   python main.py

 5. **Enjoy the Game!**
    Use the keyboard and mouse to explore the voxel world, manipulate blocks, and interact with the environment.

## Controls

**W, A, S, D: Move the player around the world.**

**Spacebar: Jump.**

**Right Mouse Button: Look around.**

**Left Mouse Button: Place blocks.**

**Right Mouse Button: Remove blocks.**

**Shift: Run.**
